BewlyBewly is a browser extension for bilibili that aims to enhance the user experience by redesigning the bilibili UI.
The design is inspired by YouTube, Vision OS, and iOS, resulting in a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
This project uses the [vitesse-webext](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-webext) template for development.
Without this template, it may not be possible to develop this project.
